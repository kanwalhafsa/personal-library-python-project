The Book That Changed Me

I remember the day I stumbled upon Atomic Habits by James Clear in a bookstore. I wasn’t looking for anything in particular, but that title pulled me in. Page after page, I realized how small actions build into massive change. That book didn’t just sit on my shelf — it helped me build consistency in everything I do, from studying to self-care. Sometimes, a single book finds you at the exact moment you need it.
