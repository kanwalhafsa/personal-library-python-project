I wasn\u2019t looking for anything in particular, but that title pulled me in. Page after page, I realized how small actions build into massive change. That book didn\u2019t just sit on my shelf \u2014 it helped me build consistency in everything I do, from studying to self-care. Sometimes, a single book finds you at the exact moment you need it.",

        "story": "From Zero to Reader\n\nI was never a reader. Books felt long, boring, and too slow for my fast-paced mind. But during one long summer break, I challenged myself to read just 10 pages a day. I started with The Silent Patient, a mystery novel that hooked me from the first chapter. Then came another book, then non-fiction. Now, books are my comfort zone. It\u2019s funny how 10 pages a day turned into a lifelong habit.",

That night, I got lost in Santiago's journey to follow his dreams. It made me think about my own goals, the signs around me, and the courage it takes to believe in yourself. That book became my late-night friend \u2014 and an eye-opener.",

The first time, it helped me get through heartbreak. The next, through a tough academic year. And the last time, it helped me find peace in chaos.
